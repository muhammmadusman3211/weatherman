# weatherman

# User can ask for either monthly or yearly reports by entering -a for monthly and -e for yearly weather reports. Next, user has to tell the year and month and the folder name. 

# I have made a main file named weatherman.rb which contains a class for calling the functions. 

# I have created a separate file for each task which containes Modules. 

# I have used file handling and it checks if the file exists or not. It outputs the results if the file exists else it tells that the file does not exist.
